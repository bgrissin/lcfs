# Overview of Layers in LCFS

This new filesystem a user-level, written in C, POSIX-compliant, and integrated into Linux and MacOS via Fuse.  It does not require any kernel modifications, making it a portable file system. This filesystem written with container image handling as a specific workload. 

Its use within Docker containers is similar to other filesystem-based storage drivers like AUFS and OverlayFS.  However, the LCFS filesystem operates directly on top of block devices, as opposed to over two filesystems that are then merged. Thereby,  LCFS aims to directly manage at the container imageâ€™s layer level, eliminate the overhead of having a second filesystem that then is merged, and to optimize for density. 

Most file systems in use today are optimized towards persistent data, provide ACID properties for system calls and aim to work well with random read-write workloads. Instead, LCFS focuses on optimizing operations for container lifecycle, including handling container image:

1. Creation
2. Cloning and launching of instances
3. Memory consumption
4. Data management - Actions like deletion, forced image removal and local system resource usage based on multiple container images being present
5. Resource management - including the number of inodes reported to the kernel by way of multiple copies of the same image (or layers) running



A lot of these mechanisms are implemented using image-specific snapshotting techniques that are optimized for page cache consumption, snap creation time and inode count.  Similarly to other graph drivers, this graph driver creates layers for images and read-write layers on top of them for containers.  Each image will have a base layer where the files of the image are populated initially. Additional layers are created on top of the base layer for each additional layer in the image being extracted.  Each layer shares data from the previous layer.  If a layer modifies any data, that data is visible from the layers on top of that layer, but not from the layers below it. Also if a container modifies data in an image it is loaded from, that modified data is not visible from any other derived layers on top of that image layer.

A layer in an image is a read-only snapshot sitting on top of the previous layer in the image.  Therefore, these derived layers share common data.  A layer is immutable after its contents are completely populated.  When any data inherited from a previous layer is modified while populating data to a new layer, a branch-on-write (BOW) operation is performed in increments of 4KB blocks.  New data will be written to a newly allocated location on the back-end block storage device, and old data will no longer be accessible from the layer that modified the data (or any other layer created on top of that subsequently).  Similarly, any files deleted from a layer are not visible from that layer or on any of the layers on top of that layer.


When a read-write layer is created while starting a new container (two such layers for every container), a read-write snapshot is created on top of the image layer and mounted from the container. The container can see all the data from the image layers below the read-write layer and can create new data or modify data as needed. When data is modified, the existing data is not modified in the image layer.  Instead, a private copy with new data is made available for the read-write layer.

Traditional file systems need to provide consistency for every system call, but for a graph driver, that is required only when a layer is created, deleted or persisted. This graph driver hosts the Docker database, with information about various images and containers.  It ensures that the database is consistent with the images and therefore the image data can be read correctly regardless of restarts or crashes.  This design eliminates the need to externally monitor or garbage inspect `/var/lib/docker`.

Snapshots are implemented without using reference counts and thus allow an unlimited number of layers. The time to create a snapshot is independent of the size of the filesystme(devices), the size of the data set, or the number of layers present in the file system. Snapshots are deleted in the background and processing time depends on the amount of data actually created/modified in the snapshot. Thus creation and deletion of layers occurs instantaneously.

A layer becomes read-only after new layers are populated on top of it, and a new layer will not conflict with any modifications in progress on the parent layer.  In a graph driver, creating a new layer or removing a layer does not have to stop any in-progress operations and thus creating or removing images and containers can proceed without any noticeable impact on other running containers.
